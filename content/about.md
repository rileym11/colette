Outside of work I enjoy being an active member of my community, volunteering whenever I can and attending local meetups. I have a strong passion for reading and continuing my 
educational journey which I satisfy through a multitude of continuing education courses from top universities. If I'm not at home in Toronto I'm most likely travelling the world on a quest to further my intercultural communication skills and of course, to meet great people and see amazing sights!
