Hello there! My name's Colette Snyder!

I'm a seasoned project manager who has led the planning, development, and implementation of programs that have involved engaging a very diverse range of stakeholders. I’ve excelled at developing partnerships. I'm comfortable at public speaking, and I’m an excellent writer.

A few of my key skills:

- Strategic Planning

- Partnership Development
- Negotiation and Conflict Resolution
- Written and Verbal Communication
- Creative Thinking and Problem Solving
- Project Management
